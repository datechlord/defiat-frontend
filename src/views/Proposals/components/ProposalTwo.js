        The power of DeFiat Points (DFTP) still has been largely untapped as DeFiat continues to grow.
        With Anystake soon to be released, DFTP will begin transitioning to a larger role in the ecosystem.
        To facilitate this transition, the development team would like to propose changing the threshold
        for DFTP generation.

        Voting Power for this contract is equal to the total DFT value of your staked holdings in the DeFiat
