        DeFiat (the “Token”)  is a utility token experiment using the ERC20 standard on the Ethereum Blockchain (The “Blockchain"). The DeFiat website and White Paper (the “WP”)  are for illustration only and do not make the Team liable for any of their content. The DeFiat website may evolve over time, including but not limited to, a change of URL, change of content, adding or removing functionalities.
        THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY OF THE TOKENS OR THE PROJECT DESCRIBED IN THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE DELIVERED. 
        REGARDLESS OF THE ACQUISITION METHOD, BY ACQUIRING THE TOKEN YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE NO RECOURSE, CLAIM, ACTION, JUDGEMENT OR REMEDY AGAINST THE TEAM IF THE UTILITY OF THE TOKENS OR IF THE PROJECT DESCRIBED IN THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IS NOT DELIVERED OR REALISED.
        <br/><br/>
        The team (The “Team”) behind the design and deployment of the Token on the Blockchain does not intend to use the token to fundraise nor to launch an Initial Coin Offering. Nevertheless, the Token may be available on Decentralized Exchanges (“DEX”) due to the open nature of such marketplaces.
        The Team does not control nor manage any listing on any decentralized exchange (“DEX”) . In the event of a listing on a decentralized exchange, the Team shall not be held responsible for any implications on the token price (The “Price).
        Due to the decentralized nature of DEX, in the event that you purchase Tokens on such DEX your purchase cannot be refunded or exchanged by the Team. 
        REGARDLESS OF THE ACQUISITION METHOD, BY ACQUIRING THE TOKEN YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE NO RECOURSE, CLAIM, ACTION, JUDGEMENT OR REMEDY AGAINST THE TEAM REGARDING ANY EVOLUTIONS OF THE PRICE OR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE TOKENS ON ANY EXCHANGE OR MARKETPLACE. 
        <br/><br/>
        IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO ANYTHING AVAILABLE OR YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO INCUR FINANCIAL LOSSES, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU NOT TO PURCHASE ANY TOKENS.  WE RECOMMEND YOU CONSULT LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS OR EXPERTS FOR FURTHER GUIDANCE BEFORE PURCHASING AMOUNTS OF THE TOKEN.
